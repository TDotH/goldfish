# Goldfish

Goldfish is a todo list app started as a final project for my full-stack web development class at Portland State University during Fall 2020.

I did the entire front-end of the project on my own, but due to time constraints I was unable to both to get the project to a level of polish that I would be happy with and do any work on the back-end part of the site. 

This repo will just be me finishing up getting an actual site up.
